# Phase N Stories

> Stories are ordered by priority. Each story must have clear acceptance criteria before moving to implementation.
>
> **Story quality checklist** (PM verifies before implementation begins):
> - [ ] At least 2 acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
> - [ ] Priority assigned (P0–P3) and agent assigned
> - [ ] Technical notes reviewed by Architect
> - [ ] No ambiguous requirements (escalate to human if unclear)
>
> **Pruning rule**: Once a story reaches `done`, replace its full content with:
> `## STORY-NNN: [Title] — COMPLETE. See STATUS.md.`
