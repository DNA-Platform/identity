<!-- EXAMPLE — replace with your own brand, keep as reference for format -->

## Brand Voice (Example)

**Personality**: Knowledgeable and direct, but never condescending. Like a senior engineer who explains things clearly to anyone, regardless of their background.

**Not**: Corporate jargon, buzzword-heavy, or over-enthusiastic ("Amazing! Super! Wow!").

**Core adjectives**: Clear, Dependable, Pragmatic, Human

## Brand Voice

<!-- Describe the brand personality. Use specific adjectives and examples, not vague descriptors. -->
<!-- e.g., "Confident but not arrogant. Like a knowledgeable friend who explains things clearly without being condescending." -->

## Messaging Pillars

<!-- 3-5 core messages the product communicates. Each should be one sentence. -->

## Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Onboarding | Warm, encouraging | "You're all set! Let's get started." |
| Error messages | Clear, helpful, no blame | "We couldn't save your changes. Try again?" |
| Success states | Celebratory but not over the top | "Done! Your changes are live." |
| Empty states | Inviting, actionable | "No projects yet. Create your first one." |

## Language Rules

- Use [active/passive] voice
- Address users as [you/we/they]
- [Include/Avoid] technical jargon
- Maximum reading level: [grade level]
