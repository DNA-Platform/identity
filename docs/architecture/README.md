# System Architecture

> Maintained by the Architect. Contains system design documents, data models, and technical specifications.

## Documents

Add architecture documents here as the system is designed:

- `SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md` — High-level system architecture diagram and component descriptions
- `DATA-MODEL.md` — Domain models and database schema
- `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` — Deployment architecture and infrastructure design
- `INTEGRATIONS.md` — Third-party service integrations

**Convention**: Each document must start with a `## TL;DR` block (≤5 lines). Agents read only the TL;DR unless the task requires deeper context. This keeps architecture docs from bloating agent context windows.
