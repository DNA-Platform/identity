# Project Configuration

## Getting Started

**New project?** Run `/intro` to kick off. The project director will walk you through scoping, team assembly, tech stack, and skill setup.

**Returning?** Run `/status` to see where things stand, or `/implement-phase` to continue work.

## Workflow

This project uses **spec-driven development** with phased delivery. Work is organized into phases, each containing user stories that are implemented, tested, and documented before presenting to the human for review.

- **`docs/WORKFLOW.md`** — Overview and links to sub-docs
- **`docs/workflow/`** — Focused sub-docs: PHASE-LIFECYCLE, STORY-FORMAT, ESCALATION, AGENT-REGISTRY
- **`docs/PROJECT.md`** — Project scope, active team roster, tech stack (generated by `/intro`)

## Agents

Agent definitions live in `.claude/agents/`. Not every project uses every agent — the active team is defined in `docs/PROJECT.md`. New agents can be added anytime by dropping a `.md` file in the agents directory.

## Key Rules

1. **Check the team roster.** Only invoke agents listed in `docs/PROJECT.md` unless the human activates more.
2. **Never present incomplete work.** Stories must pass QA before human review.
3. **Escalate only when required.** Design approvals, ambiguous requirements, and major tech choices need human input. Everything else should be resolved between agents.
4. **Context is precious.** Keep files focused. Load only what's needed for the current task. Reference docs by path instead of inlining.
5. **Test everything.** No story is "done" without passing tests.
6. **Document as you go.** Don't let docs drift.

## Commands

```bash
# Common project commands (update these per-project)
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run test         # Run all tests
npm run test:unit    # Unit tests only
npm run test:e2e     # End-to-end tests
npm run lint         # Lint and format
```

## Project Structure

  agents/                # Agent definitions (extensible — drop in new .md files)

  mcp.json               # MCP server configuration
```

## MCP Servers

- **Context7** — Up-to-date library documentation. Add `use context7` to prompts needing current API docs.
- Additional MCP servers configured in `.claude/mcp.json`.
